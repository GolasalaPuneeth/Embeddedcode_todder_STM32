this is code for 7X8 matrix keypad. 
used IC is STM32F1 series.
seven horizontal and six vertical pins configured.
(DFPLAYER-MINI) micro-controller to pick mp3s.
While going to heavy configuration Horizontal pins must be PULL_DOWN to GND(used 220ohms resistor). 
Horizontal pins are drivers and vercital are sense pins.
library used DFROBOTMINIPLAYER.H and KEYPAD.H
